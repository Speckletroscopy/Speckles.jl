- Witten Floquet time crystal
	- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floquet_theory)
	- Bloch theorem in time
	- Potential for setting up periodic conditions which will allow for intensity time signal folding.
	
- In the interest of time:
	- Make plot of signal when measuring photon counts beyond shot noise limit and using deadtime = 0
	- Additional plots to see how the signal falls off as photon counts are reduced and deadtime is increased
